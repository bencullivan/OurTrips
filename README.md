(This was used to see the basis for a chat UI and chat adapter, the ones in our 
app are loosely based off of the layout here, the goal was to achieve a multi 
sided messaging UI similar to I-Message, this tutorial gave us the background 
knowledge needed to accomplish that.)




Note: There may be additional tutorials that we forgot to include, these are the ones that we remember.

Note: Stack Overflow was used A LOT :) in order to fix bugs and answer questions that we had.

Note: The notes from class were also consulted especially when creating features such as "Locations".

Note: We also referenced our MyRuns projects in order to remember how we created list view adapters, custom dialog fragments etc...

We had an AWESOME time creating this app!
