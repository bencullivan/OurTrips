# Our Trips

Authors: Ben Cullivan & Omar Alsaeed.

The Our Trips app was created with the goal of connecting people across the globe through vacations. Sign up for the app, 
build your network of friends, and find dates that you and your friends are available to go on a trip! Our trips provides 
a single centralized location for planning a trip, sharing media, locations, and comments with your fellow trippers, 
and viewing past trips so that none of your memories are lost!

Open Source Libraries from Github that were used:

• [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide)

• [Android Image Cropper](https://github.com/ArthurHub/Android-Image-Cropper)

• [TimesSquare for Android](https://github.com/square/android-times-square)

• [Image Picker](https://github.com/Dhaval2404/ImagePicker)

We had an AWESOME time creating this app!

The OurTrips app is not being distributed commercially.
